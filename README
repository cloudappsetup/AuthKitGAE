Google App Engine plugin for AuthKit

This package contains the components to support authentication and authorization
on the Google App Engine.
The authentication and authorization components are independent of each other,
so you can use them separately.



Using the authentication

To use the GAE Users API based authentication all you need to do is put the
following values into your configuration file:
    authkit.setup.method = google
    authkit.google.signoutpath = /path/to/signout

The authkit.google.signoutpath work just like authkit.cookie.signoutpath, and
just like the latter can be omitted if you don't wish to allow signing out.

You can also specify the UsersProvider it will use to acquire the roles of the
signed in users by setting:
    authkit.google.authenticate.user.type = package.name:UsersProvider
    authkit.google.authenticate.user.data = ...
Where package.name:UsersProvider should be replaced with a valid
authkit.users.Users subclass.



Using the authorization

If you wish to use the GAE Datastore to store the users, roles and groups, then
you should use the authkit_gae.users:UsersFromDatastore class as your
*.authenticate.user.type .

You can use it with either the GAE authentication plugin or with the built in
forms authentication method.

UsersFromDatastore uses the predefined UserRole, UserGroup and BaseUser classes
from authkit_gae.models to store the data in the Datastore. If you wish you can
create a subclass of BaseUser and let the UsersFromDatastore use that by setting
the *.authenticate.user.data to point to that calss, for example:
    authkit.google.authenticate.user.data = package.name:MyUser



Using both at the same time

When using both at the same time, you can specify a magic role that will appear
for the administrators by:
    authkit.google.adminrole = superuser

When changing the role in a already existing system, the role name must not
conflict with any other pre-existing roles in the Datastore.

Here is an example of a configuration utilizing all the features mentioned
above:
    authkit.setup.method = google
    authkit.google.signoutpath = /auth/signout
    authkit.google.adminrole = admin
    authkit.google.authenticate.user.type = authkit_gae.users:UsersFromDatastore
    authkit.google.authenticate.user.data = myblog.models:BlogUser
